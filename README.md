# GiveEmTheBoot

A valheim mod which empowers the unarmed kick attack. Knockback will send foes in an upward diagonal direction, dependent on their weight. Trolls will be slightly nudged, Greylings will be caber-tossed. Gets stronger with your unarmed skill, as well as the weight of your legwear. At 100 unarmed skill and with iron leg armor, a greyling will be yeeted 50+ feet away. It's the unarmed kick you always wanted.
